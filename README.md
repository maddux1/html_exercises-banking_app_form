These are my notes on Markdown

- cmd+shift+P will demo in a window what you've typed in md so far

- enclose things in * to make them asterix or _blah_ you can do it <- that way

- you can do two spaces and that will function the same as a carriage return

- **double asterix** on both sides makes things bold

~~this is how you do a strikeout~~

1. first 
* something important
2. second 
-second important thing
3. third

```
var cat = "meow";
```
